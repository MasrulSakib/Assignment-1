A donation website is a website that enables visitors to donate money or other resources to a charitable organization or cause.

In my implementation, I used HTML and CSS to design and structure the website. HTML was used to create the basic layout of the webpage, while CSS was used to style the webpage with colors, fonts, and other visual elements.
