            <h2>Thousands of hunger people</h2>
            <p id="para">Eating alone is a disappointment. But not eating matter more, is hollow and
                green, has
                thorns like a chain of fish hooks, trailing from the heart, clawing at your insides. Hunger feels like
                pincers, like the bite of crabs; it burns, burns, and has no fur. Let us sit down soon to eat with all
                those who haven’t eaten; let us spread great tablecloths, put salt in lakes of the world, set up
                planetary bakeries, tables with strawberries in snow, and a plate like the moon itself from which we can
                all eat. For now I ask no more than the justice of eating. <span class="color">~ Pablo Neruda, Chilean

                <h2>Shelter for poor</h2>
                <p>We think sometimes that poverty is only being hungry, naked and homeless. The poverty of being
                    unwanted,
                    unloved and uncared for is the greatest poverty. We must start in our own homes to remedy this kind
                    of
                    poverty.</p>

                <p>Recent research shows that many children who do not have enough to eat wind up with diminished
                    capacity
                    to understand and learn. Children don’t have to be starving for this to happen.</p>

                    fatherless families with extra benefits and welfare perks.</p>

                We may be comfortably living in our apartments or houses. We may not be getting affected by hunger
                during this time of despair. But there are so many people out there who may not have eaten a proper meal
                in the last few days. The turmoil caused by the COVID 19 pandemic is playing havoc in the lives of
                millions of people from all around the world. We are all in this together. We all can do our bit. Let's
                feed the hungry and help the less fortunate among us. Together we can make this world a better place.

            <p>Self-satisfaction makes life worth living. We live in a world that encompasses a major share of the poor
                and downtrodden. Each person may have a different need in his/her life. While some yearn for success,
                some don’t have the most basic amenities such as a shelter or enough food to eat. But that’s not all,
                some people may be in need of mere affection, those who are longing to see smiles. We are lucky to be
                living a comfortable life. How good it will be if we try to bring smiles to those sad faces? Generosity
                is an easily doable exercise. We all must remember one thing that helping others is a blessing in
                disguise. Because when we help others to grow, we grow in the process too. It adds value and meaning to
                our lives.</p>
